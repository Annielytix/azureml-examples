# CLI (preview)

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the new Azure ML CLI extension (preview) in a series of Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate managing the ML lifecycle from the command line.

This tutorial consists of three notebooks:

- [1.manage-assets.ipynb](1.manage-assets.ipynb)
- [2.train-models.ipynb](2.train-models.ipynb)
- [3.deploy-models.ipynb](3.deploy-models.ipynb)

You can view the GitHub Actions workflow file which installs the CLI and runs the notebooks [here](../../.github/workflows/tutorial-using-cli.yml).
